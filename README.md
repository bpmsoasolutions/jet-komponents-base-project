# jet-komponents-base-project

This project is a base project generated with the oracleÂ´s jet generator, to show you how to integrate with our library "[jet-komponents](https://github.com/bpmsoasolutions/jet-komponents)".

As you can see in the first commit you have all the base project configured with the jet-components library, then the second commit shows to you, how we migrate jet components to our jet-komponents.

Thanks and we hope this will be useful!
